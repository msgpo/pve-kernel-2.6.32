FIRMWARE:
=========

We create our own firmware package, which includes the firmware for
all proxmox-ve kernels. So far this include

pve-kernel-2.6.18
pve-kernel-2.6.24
pve-kernel-2.6.32
pve-kernel-2.6.35

We use 'find-firmware.pl' to extract lists of required firmeware
files.  The script 'assemble-firmware.pl' is used to read those lists
and copy the files from various source directory into a target
directory.

We do not include firmeware for some wireless HW when there is a
separate debian package for that, for example:

zd1211-firmware
atmel-firmware
bluez-firmware 


PATCHES:
--------

 bootsplash-3.1.9-2.6.31-rh.patch: bootsplash patch

 bridge-patch.diff: Avoid bridge problems with changing MAC
  see also: http://forum.openvz.org/index.php?t=msg&th=5291

  Behaviour after 2.6.27 has changed slighly - after setting mac address
  of bridge device, then address won't change. So we could omit
  that patch, requiring to set hwaddress in /etc/network/interfaces.


Additional information
----------------------

We use the default configuration provided by openvz, and apply
the following modification:

see config-2.6.32.diff

- enable bootsplash 
	CONFIG_FB_VESA=y 
	CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=Y 
	CONFIG_BOOTSPLASH=y

- disable CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO

- disable CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME

- enable common CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XXX to avoid hardware detection
  problems (udev, undate-initramfs hav serious problems without that)

  	 CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
  	 CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=y
  	 CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM=y

- disable module signatures (CONFIG_MODULE_SIG, CONFIG_CRYPTO_SIGNATURE)
 
- enable usbip (this is also enable on debian kernels)
 
  	 CONFIG_USB_IP_COMMON=m
	 CONFIG_USB_IP_VHCI_HCD=m
	 CONFIG_USB_IP_HOST=m

- enable IBM JFS file system 

  This is disabled in RHEL kernel for no real reason, so we enable
  it as requested by users (bug #64)

- enable apple HFS and HFSPLUS

  This is disabled in RHEL kernel for no real reason, so we enable
  it as requested by users

- enable CONFIG_BRIDGE=y

  Else we get warnings on boot, that
  net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables is an unknown key

- disable CONFIG_BRIDGE_IGMP_SNOOPING 

  To avoid problems with multicasting. Various users reported
  multipath problems, which can be avoided by turning off IGMP
  snooping.

- use 'deadline' as default scheduler

  This is the suggested setting for KVM. We also measure bad fsync
  performance with ext4 and cfq.

- set CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y

  because if not set, it can give some dynamic memory or cpu frequencies 
  change, and vms can crash (mainly windows guest).

  see http://forum.proxmox.com/threads/18238-Windows-7-x64-VMs-crashing-randomly-during-process-termination?p=93273#post93273

Testing final kernel with kvm
-----------------------------

kvm -kernel data/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-6-pve -initrd initrd.img-2.6.32-6-pve -append "vga=791 video=vesafb:ywrap,mtrr splash=silent" /dev/zero
